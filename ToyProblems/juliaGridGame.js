/*

Julia is playing a game on an infinite 2-D grid with the bottom left cell referenced as (1,1). All the cells contain 0 initially.
The game consists of n steps, and in each step Julia is given two integers a and b.

The value of each of the cells in the coordinate (u,v) is increased by 1. After n such steps, if x is the largest number in any cell on the board, how many instances of x are on the board?

As parameter, you're given a string array, STEPS, denoting the values of a and b for each of steps of the game. The game should return the total # of occurrences of greatest integer X after N steps.
